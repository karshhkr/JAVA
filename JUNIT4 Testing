In this we would be learning about Unit Testing4
 where we would learn about the testing hwo the chuncks and the whole method or a class  are beeen tested by the Test Enginners/Testers

1.write the test 
 2.based on test we develop some specific test 
 3.and on that run test passing or not on that thsi unit we be develop or not develop and according to it  modification on that instances



 Unit Testing :- testing is logic is justifed or  not
 testing  specific unit of code independentely

  Integration testing :- is said to be an testing where we test whole class  whole unit is been tested 

   adv of unit tetsing:- 
   1. bugs are find at early test in code in development and easy to solve
   2. fix the bug easily in early stage reduce time complexity and cost
   
    How to perform unit testing :-

    JUNIT:- is library /framework for unittesting most popular one 
    .Imp version is 4 and 5 JUNIT version 

    Mockito :- mocking frame work
    uses of it :- repositorty is created interact with db if you wanat to check if you dont have db 
    it create the repository  copy to check the logic and check the service
