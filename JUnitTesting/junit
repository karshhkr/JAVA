testing vs Unit testing:-
testing something done of application 
 testing:- test enginner/ tester  
 unit testing:- only  SDE is doing it who write the code for the application

 sdlc :-
 1. design the application
 2. write the code 
 3. testing the application by test enginners

    * its the done post development


 *1.write the test 
 2.based on test we develop some specific test 
 3.and on that run test passing or not on that thsi unit we be develop or not develop and according to it  modification on that instancest

 Unit Testing :- testing is logic is justifed or  not
 testing  specific unit of code independentely

  Integration testing :- is said to be an testing where we test whole class  whole unit is been tested 

   adv of unit tetsing:- 
   1. bugs are find at early test in code in development and easy to solve
   2. fix the bug easily in early stage reduce time complexity and cost
   
    How to perform unit testing :-

    JUNIT:- is library /framework for unittesting most popular one 
    .Imp version is 4 and 5 JUNIT version 

    Mockito :- mocking frame work
    uses of it :- repositorty is created interact with db if you wanat to check if you dont have db 
    it create the repository  copy to check the logic and check the service

     junit Archutecture:- 

     Junit4 + new features  is not  jUnit5
{
Junit platform:-
        Test engine API 
      responsible for launching testing framework on JVM


     Jupiter API == is been used towrite the test and then platform will be use to run the test 
      
      Junit Jupiter:-
      new annotarion are there 
      new  progamming and extection model are there 
      test engine implementation 


    JUnit5  == Junit Unit4 is not provide backward functionaloty it works as it need an API (Vintage) to perforn the exixting  test to be perform with Junit5and then ru the tst over the platform

    Juit Vintage:-
    provide 3-4 junit backend compatibility

}
 This all make Junit5 implementations
